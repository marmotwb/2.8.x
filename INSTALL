Website Baker 2 Installation Instructions
============================================
This will quickly explain what you will need
to install website baker.

First of all, you must have a webserver with
PHP and MySQL installed correctly. Once you 
have got that, place the "wb" folder 
somewhere on your server, probably under the
document root:
e.g. /documentroot/wb

This should be accessed by an address 
something like this:
e.g. http://localhost/wb/

Now create a blank MySQL database
(Commonly called "wb").

Once that is all done simple run the
install script from your browser:
e.g. http://localhost/wb/install/index.php

Fill-out the form and submit it, and if all
the details are correct, you should be taken
to Website Baker Administration.
